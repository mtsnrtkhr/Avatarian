Please save your favorite avatar image in the avatars folder in either jpg or png format.

You can install this app in 3 steps for Windows.
1. Install C++ compiler  
2. Install C++ (Cmake)  
3. Install Python  

A lot of user may use this app for work.
Then you need to care about licence of C++ compiler.  
I recommend [Microsoft C++ Build Tool](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ja/visual-cpp-build-tools/) for it.
See the article below for licence.
